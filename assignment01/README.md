# Assignment Requirements

1. The form at the top of this page consists of a text box, a list of radio buttons, and two drop down lists. For the Genre list, make the other choices “Baroque,” “Renaissance,” and “Realism.” For the Bulk Actions list, make the others choices “Archive,” “Edit,” “Delete,” and “Collection.” 
The drop-down list items should have numeric values starting with 0. Notice the placeholder text in the search box. 
2. Create a table of paintings that looks similar to that shown in the figure. Be sure to make the table properly accessible. 
3. The checkboxes in the table should be an array of elements—for example, <input type="checkbox" name "index[]" value="10" />. The name and values are arbitrary, but each checkbox needs to have a unique value. 
4. The action buttons in each row are a series of <button> containers with the type="button" attribute (this prevents them from submitting the form) and an image within the button. 
5. Set the form’s method attribute to GET and its action attribute to https://www.randyconnolly.com/tests/process.php. 
6. While some of the styling has been provided, you will have to add some additional CSS styling. A selection of colors are defined within variables-palette-7.css
